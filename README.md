# SpermNet Project

Code used to compute evolutionary conserved core meiotic genes among three species: *Homo Sapiens* (HS), *Mus Musculus* (MM), and *Drosophila Melanogaster* (DM).


Each folder identifies portions of the project, each containing more details.
- `1-diff-gene-exp`: Computes Differentially Express Genes based on RNAseq gene expression levels.
- `2-core_genes`: Defines evolutionary conserved (core) genes among the three species.
- `3-screened-data`: Matches wet-lab experimental results with the core genes.
