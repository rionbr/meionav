Folder instructions:
-------------

Folders identify different portions of the project, each containing additional details.
- `01-diff-gene-exp`: Differentially Expressed Gene Analysis based on RNAseq gene expression levels.
- `02-core_genes`: Defining evolutionary conserved (core) genes among Fruit fly, Mouse and Humans.
- `03-screened-data`: Match wet-lab experimental results with the core and network genes.
- `04-network`: Network Science analysis, including orthoBackbone computation.
- `05-data-analysis`: Data analysis, simulations, machine learning experiments, and general plotting.
- `data`: placeholders for downloaded third-party data.
- `images`: inhouse designed images used in the project.
- `networkbrowser`: Frontend of the [Meiotic Navigator](https://pages.igc.pt/meionav/) (PHP, HTML+CSS coding).
