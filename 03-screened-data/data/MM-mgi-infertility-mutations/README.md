# Identification of MM genes with mutations linked to male infertility

We identified all MM genes with mutations that were associated to male infertility


For that we used the resource MGI and searched for phenotype "(male intertility)[http://www.informatics.jax.org/vocab/mp_ontology/MP:0001925]" (MP:0001925).
Then a (batch query)[http://www.informatics.jax.org/batch] for all identified genes was performed on the resource.
